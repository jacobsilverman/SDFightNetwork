## Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified:

- `public/manifest.json` - Web app manifest defining PWA properties
- `public/sw.js` - Service worker for offline functionality
- `src/shared/PWAInstallButton.jsx` - Install prompt component
- `src/shared/PWAInstallButton.scss` - Styles for install button
- `src/shared/OfflineIndicator.jsx` - Offline status indicator
- `src/shared/OfflineIndicator.scss` - Styles for offline indicator

### PWA Requirements Met:

âœ… **Web App Manifest** - Defines app name, icons, colors, and display mode
âœ… **Service Worker** - Provides offline functionality and caching
âœ… **HTTPS** - Required for PWA functionality (when deployed)
âœ… **Responsive Design** - Works on all device sizes
âœ… **Install Prompt** - Automatic install button when conditions are met
âœ… **iOS Meta Tags** - Proper Apple-specific meta tags for iPhone support

## Development

### Local Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing PWA Features:
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Serve the built files: `npm run preview`
3. Open Chrome DevTools
4. Go to Application tab
5. Check "Manifest" and "Service Workers" sections
6. Test install prompt and offline functionality

## Browser Support

- **Chrome**: Full PWA support with install prompt
- **Safari (iOS)**: Manual install via "Add to Home Screen"
- **Firefox**: Full PWA support
- **Edge**: Full PWA support

## Notes

- The PWA install prompt will only appear when the app meets certain criteria (HTTPS, valid manifest, etc.)
- On iOS, users must manually add the app to their home screen using Safari's share menu
- The service worker provides basic offline caching for core app files
- The app will work offline for cached content

## Troubleshooting

If the install prompt doesn't appear:
1. Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for PWA)
2. Check that the manifest.json is accessible
3. Verify the service worker is registered
4. Clear browser cache and try again
5. Check browser console for any errors

For iOS users who can't install:
1. Make sure you're using Safari browser
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Check that the site is loaded completely
4. Ensure you're not in private browsing mode
